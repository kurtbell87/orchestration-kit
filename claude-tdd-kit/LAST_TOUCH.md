# Last Touch — Cold-Start Briefing

## What to do next

_Describe the immediate next task. Be specific — include the exact command to run if applicable._

## Key files for current task

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| _path/to/file_ | _What it does and why it matters for the current task_ |

## Don't waste time on

- **Build verification** — _e.g., `build/` is current, 42 tests pass._
- **Dependency checks** — _e.g., All installed._
- **Codebase exploration** — read directory `README.md` files instead.

## Architecture overview

_A short diagram or description of how the main components connect. Keep it under 10 lines._

## Test coverage

- _e.g., 42 unit tests — `npm test`_
- _All passing._
