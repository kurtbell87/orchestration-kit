# Research Questions

The research agenda for this project. Questions are organized by priority and status.

---

## 1. Goal

_What is the overarching research objective?_

**Success looks like:** _How do you know the research program is "done"?_

---

## 2. Constraints

| Constraint | Decision |
|------------|----------|
| Framework  | _e.g., PyTorch, JAX_ |
| Compute    | _e.g., 1x A100, 4x V100_ |
| Timeline   | _e.g., 3 months_ |
| Baselines  | _e.g., PPO on MuJoCo Hopper, published result X_ |

---

## 3. Non-Goals (This Phase)

_What are you explicitly NOT investigating right now?_

---

## 4. Open Questions

_Prioritized list of research questions. Each should be addressable by one or more experiments._

Status: `Not started` | `In progress` | `Answered` | `Blocked` | `Deferred`

| Priority | Question | Status | Parent | Blocker | Decision Gate | Experiment(s) |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| P0 | _Most important question_ | Not started | — | — | _What decision changes?_ | — |
| P1 | _Second question_ | Not started | — | — | _What decision changes?_ | — |
| P2 | _Third question_ | Not started | — | — | _What decision changes?_ | — |

## 5. Answered Questions

_Move questions here as experiments resolve them._

| Question | Answer Type | Answer | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| _Example: Does entropy reg help on CartPole?_ | REFUTED | _No — exp-001 refuted_ | _results/exp-001/analysis.md_ |

Answer types: `CONFIRMED` | `REFUTED` | `Deferred` | `Superseded`

## 6. Working Hypotheses

_Current best understanding. Update as experiments produce evidence._

- _Hypothesis 1: ..._
- _Hypothesis 2: ..._
